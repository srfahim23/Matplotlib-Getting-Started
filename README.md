# Matplotlib-Getting-Started
# Installing of Matplotlib
If you have Python and PIP already installed on system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.

Install it using this command:

    c:\Users\Your Name>pip install matplotlib

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed, like Anaconda, Spyder etc.

# Import Matplotlib
Once Matplotlib is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import module statement:

    import matplotlib

Now Matplotlib is imported and ready to use:

# Checking Matplotlib Version 
The version string is stored under __version__ attribute.

Example

    import matplotlib
    print(matplotlib.__version__)

NOTE: two underscore charecters are used in __version__.
