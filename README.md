# Matplotlib-Getting-Started
# Installing of Matplotlib
If you have Python and PIP already installed on system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.

Install it using this command:

    c:\Users\Your Name>pip install matplotlib

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed, like Anaconda, Spyder etc.
